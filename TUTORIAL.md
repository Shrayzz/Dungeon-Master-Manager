# Tutorial: How to Play Dungeon Master Manager

## 1️⃣ Storyboard

Your journey begins in a training camp where you learn to wield a sword and cast spells. You have completed your final year at this camp. The camp master gives you your first sword and spell. You have now become a minimum rank F Adventurer.

The next day, as you return home to the city, you hear a young passerby at a bar talking about the Greul's quest. This mysterious, distant dungeon houses an ancient dragon in a treacherous quarry. It's said that this quarry holds a vast treasure. The young man also mentions that no one has dared to approach it due to the dragon's presence. This dragon supposedly plunged an entire country into chaos in the past, which is quite terrifying.

You join the adventurers' guild near your home and ask the Guild Master about this quest. He laughs and mocks you, indicating that this quest is of rank S, the highest level.

Your goal is to climb the adventurer ranks one by one until you become a rank S adventurer and much stronger than you are now.

## 2️⃣ Missions

Each mission has a rank indicating its difficulty and the rewards you can earn by completing it. Rewards include gold, experience, weapons, potions, and characters.

In each mission, you can choose up to 4 characters, including the main character, as you will recruit multiple characters throughout your adventure to build your team:

## 3️⃣ Characters

To purchase this quest, you can't achieve the goal alone. You'll need to build your team and recruit characters. Due to your low adventurer credibility, some characters can only be unlocked at certain experience levels.

Each character has their own characteristics:
* Adventurer rank
* HP / ATK / DEF
* Combat style (sword, bow, spell, healer...)
* Speed (SPD) and accuracy (ACC)
* Critical hit chance %

During a mission, each character will lose points from the attributes listed above. At the end of a mission, lost points regenerate gradually based on the severity of their injuries.

## 4️⃣ Experience

When you complete a mission, you accumulate experience. There are 7 ranks available in the game:
* Rank S = 45,000 EXP
* Rank A = 29,000 EXP
* Rank B = 11,000 EXP
* Rank C = 4,500 EXP
* Rank D = 1,000 EXP
* Rank E = 150 EXP
* Rank F = 0 EXP

*Experience accumulates across all ranks. When you reach rank S, you have MAX EXP instead of a specific EXP number.*

You can also gain EXP by purchasing items in a shop, depending on the value of the item. The amount of EXP gained will be indicated for each item.

You have an experience bar that shows exactly how much experience you have accumulated in total.

## 5️⃣ Shops

Shops act as checkpoints appearing randomly on the mission map. In these shops, you can buy various items:
* Swords
* Bows
* Healing (HP+)
* Testosterone (ATK+ / SPD+)
* Mineral iron (DEF+)
* Zinc (ACC+)
* Spells

Most shops offer simple, fairly weak items, but some (with a lower appearance rate) can offer more powerful and effective items.

## 6️⃣ Weapons and Healing

Each weapon has infinite durability, meaning that once obtained, the weapon cannot break.

Each weapon has its own characteristics:
* HP / ATK / DEF
* Speed (SPD) and accuracy (ACC)
* Critical hit chance %
* Recoil chance when used
